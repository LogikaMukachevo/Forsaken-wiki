    <p>Welcome to The Unofficial Forsaken Wiki! This Wiki holds many information from characters to lore and more based off the popular Roblox game FORSAKEN. Forsaken (aka DAMNATION), is a multiplayer asymmetric horror game owned by Hytok0 and Basil.

    <h1>they also have abilities</h1>
     <h2>Noob:</h2>
     <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/a/a1/ColaCore.png"/>
     <p>Bloxy Cola</p>
      <p>Noob drinks a can of Bloxy Cola for 2.5 seconds, granting them Speed I for 10 seconds and removing all existing Slowness effects. While drinking, Noob cannot sprint and has 10% less speed.</p>
     <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/f/f7/SlateskinCore.png"/>
     <p>Slateskin Potion</p>
      <p>Noob drinks a bottle of Slateskin Potion for 1.5 seconds, giving them Slateskin II for 6 seconds, providing 80 overheal but slowing them by 45%. The ability can be recast after 2.5 seconds of usage to remove the effect manually. If Slateskin wears off naturally (waiting for the Slateskin effect to wear off), Noob gains Speed II for 2 seconds, but if it is ended manually, it only gives Speed I. While drinking, Noob has 40% less speed and cannot sprint. Unlike other abilities, the cooldown for this ability only triggers once Noob's Slateskin effect wears off.</p>
     <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/6/65/GhostburgerCore.png"/>
     <p>Ghostburger</p>
      <p>Noob eats a Ghostburger for around 2.20 seconds, gaining Undetectable I and Invisibility IV for 10 seconds. Note that Undetectable doesn't work if they're the last survivor standing. While eating, Noob has 40% less speed. Using this when minions are chasing you or when you are highlighted by an ESP ability (such as 1x1x1x1 Unstable Eye) earns you the Deodorant achievement.</p>
      <h2>Elliot:</h2>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/b/bf/Pizza_toss%2C_Elliot.png"/>
      <p>Pizza Throw</p>
      <p>Elliot tosses a pizza infront of him that can instantly heal other survivors for 15 HP then it heals 20 HP over 2.5 seconds.</p>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/0/08/Rush_Hour%2C_Elliot.png"/>
      <p>Rush Hour</p>
      <p>After Elliot heals any player, except for other Elliots, they gain a charge for this ability.
Using a charge grants Elliot Speed III for 3 seconds. Elliot starts the round with 1 charge for this ability. Max 1 charge</p>
 <h2>Shedletsky:</h2>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/7/76/Shedletsky_slash.png"/>
      <p>SLASH</p>
      <p>Shedletsky slashes forward, dealing 30 damage and stunning the killer for 3 seconds if it hits. Upon activation, Shedletsky is given Resistance II for 0.575 seconds, alongside being slowed down by 75% for 1.575 seconds.</p>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/5/51/Fried_chicken.png"/>
      <p>FRIED CHICKEN</p>
      <p>Shedletsky pulls out a piece of fried chicken and takes a bite out of it, immediately restoring 5 HP and 35 HP across the span of 10 seconds. Using this slows him by 75% for 3 seconds. If Shedletsky is hit at any point, the regeneration is cancelled. Note that this depends on which way you are hit, and as such, minions cannot interrupt your healing. This ability only has two charges before becoming unusable.</p>
      <h2>Two Time:</h2>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/a/a4/Stab_Ability.png"/>
      <p>Sacrifical Dagger</p>
      <p>Two Time instantly stabs forward and gains Resistance I for 0.7 seconds.
Landing a stab to the front will do 10 damage, heal Two Time for 10 HPHP, and apply Slowness II and Helpless I to the killer for 1s.
Landing a stab to the back will instead do 20 damage, stun the killer for 3.5s, and heal Two Time for 20 HPHP.
Using this ability whilst crouched quickly lunges you forward with a stab that has an increased windup time and increased endlag.
Landing a stab on a summon does not grant OBLATION progress or healing.</p>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/3/38/Crouch_Ability.png"/>
      <p>Crouch</p>
      <p>Two Time crouches down to silence their footsteps and become stealthier.
Two Time remains crouched for at most 10 seconds, but can uncrouch whenever they need to.
Crouching applies Undetectable I and Invisibility III for at most ten seconds.
Uncrouching manually will forcibly remove these statuses and do one of the follow:
If Two Time is far from the killer, uncrouching manually will briefly reveal Two Time and apply Slowness II for up to 15s depending on how far Two Time is from the killer.
If Two Time is somewhat close to the killer, uncrouching manually will have no additional effects.
If Two Time is very close to the killer, uncrouching manually will instead grant Two Time Speed II for 1s.</p>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/1/18/Ritual_Ability.png"/>
      <p>Ritual</p>
      <p>Two Time inscribes a respawn location on the ground.
Dying with a full OBLATION bar will instantly teleport Two Time to this point.
This ability can only be used once per round.
If Two Time becomes the last survivor alive and has not already entered their second life, RITUAL will automatically trigger regardless of whether OBLATION was full or not.
If this happens, Two Time will additionally have their maximum healthHP increased to 110, be healed for up to 40 HPHP, and will not be afflicted with Weakness V</p>
 <h2>Guest 1337:</h2>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/a/a6/Guestblock.png"/>
      <p>Block</p>
      <p>Guest 1337 braces for impact, applying Resistance V for 1s and has their movement speed reduced by 40% for 2s.
Upon successfully blocking an attack, Guest 1337 has their movement speed restored, their Resistance status removed, and is given Speed I for 2s.

Successful blocks restore a charge for Guest 1337's Punch ability.</p>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/c/ca/Guestcharge.png"/>
      <p>Charge</p>
      <p>Guest 1337 dashes forward in a shoulder-bash pose for 1.5s.
If Guest 1337 collides with the killer during his charge, then the killer is knocked back and inflicts them with Helpless I for 1.25s. Guest 1337 is also granted Resistance V for 1.25s.

Failing to land a charge on an enemy inflicts Slowness II for 3 times Guest 1337's distance from the nearest killer divided by 13. The charge ends automatically if Guest 1337 crashes into a wall.

Guest 1337 cannot gain stamina while charging.</p>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/2/2d/Guestpunch.png"/>
      <p>Punch</p>
      <p>Guest 1337 winds up his fist for 0.8s and punches forward, stunning any killer within range of his punch for 2s.
If this ability is used within 1s of a successful block, then it becomes a Parry.

Parried punches have a windup time of 0.625s and stun the killer for 3.5s.</p>
<h2>007n7:</h2>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/4/40/CloneCore.png"/>
      <p>Clone</p>
      <p>When activated, 007n7 taps into his exploits to create a clone of himself that lives for 10s before dying. Upon creating a clone, 007n7 is given Invisibility IV and Undetectable I for 4 seconds. If 007n7 touches their clone after 2 seconds of it being created, the clone will immediately die.
The clone, by default, will wander aimlessly, but this can be changed through using the Inject ability (see below). (007n7's clone's aura will be white.)</p>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/4/4f/InjectCore.png"/>
      <p>c00lgui</p>
      <p>007n7 stays in place for 6 seconds before teleporting away to the furthest survivor spawn location from him.
Being hit and/or starting a generator repair cancels it immediately, and the player will need to wait for the 50s cooldown to end for the ability to be used again.</p>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/4/40/Inject.png"/>
      <p>Inject</p>
      <p>Upon activation, the clones created using 007n7's Clone ability will have their movement type switched.(This will not change the current clone's movement type if there is one.)
Aimless Wandering: The clone wanders around randomly & aimlessly.
Pathfinding: The clone pathfinds to the furthest survivor spawn.
Cursor: The clone moves towards the player's cursor. On mobile, the clone will instead run in the direction the player is facing, so using shiftlock is not advised.</p>
<h2>Builderman:</h2>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/6/66/Sentry_construction%2C_Buildderman.png"/>
      <p>Sentry</p>
      <p>Builderman receives Weakness I for 2 seconds and takes 6 seconds to construct a Sentry in front of him.

Sentries have 30 Health and target nearby killers, dealing damage and inflicting Slowness II for 1 second. If Builderman is damaged while building a Sentry, it will be destroyed and the ability will be cancelled. If destroyed after built, will give 3$ and 12 EXP.

Builderman can only have 1 Sentry active at once, and will destroy any previously active Sentry you placed. Sentries have a target range of 32.5 studs, which decreases by 16% for every additional Sentry currently active. Sentry target range cannot go below 8 studs.

Other buildings cannot be built within 62.5 studs of a Sentry. Sentry does 0.7-0.6 damage per hit to the killer.</p>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/2/20/Dispenser_Construction%2C_Builderman.png"/>
      <p>Dispenser</p>
      <p>Builderman receives Weakness I for 2 seconds and takes 6 seconds to construct a Dispenser infront of him.

Dispensers have 15 Health and heal in a 16 stud radius. If Builderman is damaged while building a Dispenser, it will be destroyed and the ability will be cancelled. Destroying it after finished building will give 3$ and 12 EXP.

Builderman can only have 1 Dispenser active at once, and will destroy any previously active Dispenser you placed. Dispensers heal 1HP/s, which decreases by 8% for every additional Dispenser currently active. Dispenser heal amount cannot go below 0.3HP/s.

Other buildings cannot be built within 30 studs of a Dispenser.</p>
<h2>Dusekkar:</h2>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/d/d3/Spawnproc.png"/>
      <p>Spawn Protection</p>
      <p>Dusekkar casts a protective shield on an ally for up to 3.5 seconds, with a range of up to 95 Studs. While active, the ally gains Resistance IV, and Dusekkar's movement speed is reduced by 25% while channeling the ability.

To maintain the shield, you must keep your cursor on the ally at all times—otherwise, it will vanish. If line of sight is broken for 2 seconds, the shield will also break. If three or more Dusekkars shield the same target, all shields will simultaneously shatter, and each Dusekkar will be inflicted with Blindness III and Slowness III for 6 seconds.</p>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/6/6c/Plasmabeam.png"/>
      <p>Plasma Beam</p>
      <p>Dusekkar spins their staff for 2 seconds before firing a beam with a range of up to 75 Studs. While casting, Dusekkar's movement speed is reduced by 25%. The beam can only hit one target. Striking a killer applies Slowness II for 3 seconds.

Striking a survivor grants them Speed I for 4 seconds and 40 overheal. The duration of the speed boost is reduced by 0.5 seconds for each additional Dusekkar alive.

It also grants them +20 overheal, but reduced by 2.5 for each other Dusekkar alive.

</p>
<h2>Taph:</h2>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/2/2d/TripwireIcon.png"/>
      <p>Tripwire</p>
      <p>Taph places a tripwire on the ground to hinder the killer and alert nearby survivors. Each Taph may have up to 3 tripwires active at a time; placing a fourth will automatically remove the oldest one, similar to John Doe's Digital Footprint.

When the killer triggers a tripwire:

All survivors within 100 studs of Taph see the killer's aura for 8 seconds.
The killer is inflicted with Slowness II for 4 seconds.
Additional info:

Tripwires have 10 health and are destroyed if struck by the killer.
After placement, they gradually become less visible over 150 seconds.
Each tripwire despawns naturally after approximately 80–85 seconds.
Stakes cannot be placed within 8 studs of one another.</p>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/b/bb/89334370123950.png"/>
      <p>Subspace Tripmine</p>
      <p>Taph arms a Subspace Tripmine and throws it onto the ground. Once placed, the mine becomes semi-invisible, briefly revealing itself every 13 seconds with a faint purple glow and sound cue.

When a killer enters within 16 studs, the mine triggers after 0.4 seconds, inflicting Helpless I for 5 seconds and Subspaced III, which applies a dark pinkish visual filter and forcibly redirects the killer's camera for 5 seconds. If Taph is within the blast radius, he is also afflicted with Subspaced III.

The Subspace Tripmine can be prematurely detonated if struck by a killer's attack:

If destroyed before activation, it inflicts a weaker Subspaced I with no Helpless I.
If left untouched for 50 seconds, it automatically explodes.
If the mine successfully detonates on a killer, its cooldown is reduced by 10 seconds.
</p>
<h2>Chance:</h2>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/d/da/Chance%27s_Favor.png"/>
      <p>COIN FLIP</p>
      <p>Chance flips a coin—if an R appears after the flip, it's heads; if not, tails.
Heads: Gain a charge for all other abilities.
Tails: Gain 1 stack of Weakness lasting 15 seconds.
Each time the coin lands on tails, the Weakness level increases by 1. There is no cap on the Weakness stacks.

When Weakness expires naturally, its level does not reset and continues to accumulate. It can only be reset by using Hat Fix.</p>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/2/2d/One_Shot.png"/>
      <p>ONE SHOT</p>
      <p>Chance pulls out an unreliable flintlock and, after a 1-second windup, pulls the trigger. Upon firing, one of the following outcomes occurs:
Flintlock explodes (25% - 15% - 5% chance): Deals 25 damage to Chance and disables the ability indefinitely until repaired using Hat Fix.
Flintlock misfires (25% - 15% - 5% chance): The flintlock fails to fire, forcing a cooldown period before it can be used again.
Flintlock fires successfully (50% - 70% - 90% chance): Shoots and stuns any killer hit within 90 studs for 1–4 seconds. The stun duration decreases linearly with distance between Chance and the killer.
The percentages represent chances at 1, 2, and 3 charges, respectively. For every additional charge of One Shot (i.e., having 2 or 3 charges), the chance of a successful shot increases by 20%, while the chances of explosion and misfire each decrease by 10%. This ability starts with 0 charges and can hold up to 3.

Using this ability removes all charges from other abilities.

For every additional Chance in the game, the stun duration of the shot is reduced by 15%.
</p>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/0/0f/Reroll.png"/>
      <p>REROLL</p>
      <p>Chance rerolls the value of his max Health.
Max Health ranges from 55 to 130. This ability starts with 0 charges and can hold up to 3 charges. Using this ability removes all charges from other abilities. It does not directly heal; instead, the percentage of remaining health stays roughly the same. For example, a Chance with 80 out of 90 health (~89% HP) will have about 99 out of 111 health (~89% HP) after the reroll.

Using this ability removes all charges from other abilities.</p>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/2/2f/Hat_fix.png"/>
      <p>HAT FIX</p>
      <p>Upon activating this ability, all Weakness stacks inflicted on Chance by Coin Flip are reset to Weakness I. It also removes any existing Weakness debuffs.

This ability can only be used after accumulating 3 charges in all other abilities.

Using this ability removes all charges from every ability and repairs Chance's gun if it has exploded.
</p>
<h1>Killers</h1>
<h2>Slasher:</h2>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/b/ba/SlasherSlash.png"/>
      <p>Slash</p>
      <p>Slasher does a basic slash with his machete, dealing 20 damage and inflicting Bleeding I for 5s, totalling about 28 damage overtime. If used while ENRAGED, Slasher lunges 19 Studs forward while slashing, and the damage is increased to 25. Unlike other main abilities, this attack can hit multiple survivors at once.

During any Friday the 13th, the damage this move deals is increased 40 with an increased 3.5s cooldown or 50 damage with a 1.5s cooldown if used while ENRAGED.

Undocumented: Hitting a survivor while the Bleeding I is still active will increase it by one level, up to Bleeding II. The timer will not reset, however.
</p>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/7/7c/SlasherBehead.png"/>
      <p>BEHEAD</p>
      <p>Slasher winds up a strong horizontal swing to the head of his target, if the player is moving during this move, they will also lunge forward in the direction they are facing. If hit, it will inflict Helpless I for 8s and deal 20 damage — or 35 if ENRAGED. Regardless of if the slash lands, Slasher is inflicted with Slowness II for 2s after swinging. Similarly to his main ability, it will also hit all survivors that are within the hitbox.

On any Friday The 13th, it deals 50 damage with a 24s cooldown instead or 75 damage with an 18s cooldown if used while ENRAGED. The lunge distance is also increased.
</p>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/7/75/SlasherGashingWound.png"/>
      <p>GASHING WOUND</p>
      <p>Slasher slices forward, attempting to catch anyone into a combination of slashes — starting with two hits from his machete, then jamming his chainsaw through the victim — before kicking them to the ground and ragdolling them for a short period. Each slash deals around 1/5th of the attack's total damage (1/10th for chainsaw) adding up to 50 in total, or 70 if Slasher is ENRAGED. Hits all survivors in its hitbox and has a lengthy endlag if failed.

On any Friday The 13th, it deals 150 damage with a 35s cooldown instead or 250 damage with a 32s cooldown if used while ENRAGED.</p>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/3/3f/RagingPaceSlasher.png"/>
      <p>RAGING PACE</p>
      <p>Upon activation, Slasher's speed becomes 19.5 for 14 seconds, and the aura of the nearest survivor is revealed to him. The aura remains revealed until his ENRAGED state ends, in which it will linger for an additional 2s.
While in effect, Slasher becomes immune to stuns, has his sprinting disabled, and has his stamina slowly become capped at 70 over the course of 6.5s. The cap is removed once he leaves his ENRAGED state.

On any Friday the 13th, Slasher's speed becomes 26.5 for the duration and his stamina is capped at 15 with a 55s cooldown instead, and all movement capabilities are heavily increased.

Undocumented: ENRAGED ends upon using any other ability. Additionally while ENRAGED, Slasher is immune to any attacks, including melee attacks, ranged attacks, and Taph's traps (though he is not immune to the Subspaced from a tripmine).</p>

      <p>WALKSPEED OVERRIDE</p>
      <p>After pressing the button on the c00lgui labeled "cl1ck 4 SPEED!1!!" while standing still for 0.2 seconds, C00lkidd performs a long lunge forward for a duration of 1.34 seconds. If C00lkidd collides with a survivor during the lunge, he halts it and slashes with the Firebrand, inflicting 30 damage, Burning I for 8 seconds, and causing significant knockback for a total of 45 damage.
Undocumented: Survivors struck experience a brief slowdown during the knockback effect. However, the survivor will not see a status effect indicator, and the slowdown dissipates quickly after the hit.

      <p>PIZZA DELIVERY</p>
      <p>After a long windup, C00lkidd summons two pizza delivery bots that automatically seek out the closest survivors. If they make contact with one, they deal 15 damage and apply Burning I (doing a total of 20 damage) and Slowness II for 3 seconds, alongside revealing the survivor's aura to C00lkidd for 7.5s, before disappearing.

      <p>CORRUPT ENERGY</p>
      <p>John Doe punches his corrupted arm into the ground and, when he pulls it out, 27 giant spikes — which have a lifespan of 14s each — emerge in front of him.

Any survivor that is directly hit by the spikes takes 12 damage, and John Doe is given Speed I for 7 seconds. The spikes cannot hit the same survivor more than 4 times.

Any survivor that is standing ontop of John Doe's spikes will be inflicted with Corrupted II for 5 seconds.

On March 18th, 256 spikes are summoned, and they deal 16.3182025 damage and last for 18.3182025 seconds instead. The spikes can now hit the same survivor for more than 4 times, while also having a lot more velocity than the other day too, making this skill brutal for sniping. The cooldown for this ability during March 18th increases to 40.3182025s.
</p>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/8/85/Digitalfootprinticon.png"/>
      <p>DIGITAL FOOTPRINT</p>

<h2>Noli:</h2>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/b/b3/Noli_Stab.webp"/>
      <p>Stab</p>
      <p>Noli uses his Shadow Tendril to stab forwards, dealing 25 damage after a 0.3s windup with a 7.5 Stud reach and having a slightly forward-shifted hitbox.
</p>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/4/49/Noli_voidrush2.png"/>
      <p>Void Rush</p>
      <p>Noli charges a rush for 1 second. If recast while charging, it cancels and goes on cooldown for 1.2 seconds, during which Noli is heavily slowed.
Hitting a survivor deals 10 damage and applies Hallucination II for 20 seconds.
After 0.85 seconds, Noli can perform a re-rush.
Hitting a survivor with Hallucination II or higher deals the default 10 damage and slams them into the ground, dealing 30 damage plus 3.5 damage for each survivor hit previously during the same Void Rush, including previous hits on that survivor and the current slam.
Rush ends early if Noli is stunned, crashes into a wall, misses hitting a survivor in time, or releases the rush key.
Turn rate is heavily increased for the first 1.12 seconds of the rush.
Noli can sprint during re-rush to temporarily boost speed.
Stamina does not regenerate during the rush.
</p>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/a/ac/Noli_nova1.png"/>
      <p>Nova</p>
      <p>Noli throws his Voidstar forward after a 0.78 second windup.
The projectile travels forward; hitting a survivor or wall causes a spherical explosion that pulls survivors toward the blast and deals 15 damage. Also has a slight slowing effect that decays the further you are from the explosions original impact.
Hitting the floor causes the Voidstar to reduce the hitbox of the explosion. Manually exploding the Voidstar by using the move again will also decrease the hitbox.</p>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/2/22/Noli_observant.png"/>
      <p>Observant</p>
      <p>Noli enters a stance, highlighting all generators and displaying a mirage above them as a warning.
After 1.45 second windup, Noli can teleport[1] a selected generator.
Survivors more than 20/50/100 studs away receive Hallucination I/II/III respectively.
Stunning Noli during windup or stance cancels the move.
Noli gains stun immunity after he teleports.
At the start of the game, Observant is placed on a 25 second cooldown.

      <p>Slash</p>
      <p>1x1x1x1 swings their sword in front of them, dealing 20 damage and inflicting Glitched I and Poisoned I for 5s. This makes 28 damage in total for the first slash on the target, although the 8 damage from the Poisoned I cannot kill survivors.
</p>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/f/fa/Massinfectionability.png"/>
      <p>MASS INFECTION</p>
      <p>Following a windup of 1.7s, 1x1x1x1 takes their two swords and performs a horizontal split with them, creating a sharp shockwave that has a lifetime of 6s and deals 35 damage to those it hits.
Inflicts Glitched II for 5s and Poisoned V for 3s if 1x1x1x1 hits a player up close.
Inflicts Glitched I and Poisoned I for 5s if 1x1x1x1 hits a player with the created shockwave.
'The windup of this attack can be heard by all players within a 400 stud radius of 1x1x1x1.
</p>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/7/7e/Entanglementability.png"/>
      <p>ENTANGLEMENT</p>
      <p>Following a windup of 0.75s, 1x1x1x1 throws their two swords, which have a lifetime of 10s, forwards at a speed of 125 studs per second. If it hits a survivor, it deals 10 damage, and 1x1x1x1 gains Speed II for 3s.

The hit survivor has their aura revealed to the killer for 2s, gains Helpless I for 10s, and gains Slowness X for 3s. The affected survivor is then required to click off 5 pop-ups to have their Slowness X removed early. After a survivor escapes ENTANGLEMENT, they gain Speed I for 1.25s.

Undocumented: Because of ENTANGLEMENT giving you speed after escaping, any speed that a survivor had before getting hit will be removed and replaced by the 1.25 seconds of Speed I.</p>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/9/9c/Unstableeyeability.png"/>
      <p>UNSTABLE EYE</p>
      <p>After a 1.5 second startup, 1x1x1x1 digs into their glaring red eye and tears at it, revealing the auras of all living survivors to them for 7s and applying Speed I for 5s, while also applying Blindness III for 5s.
Undocumented: This ability can also be heard by survivors within 400 studs of 1x1x1x1, although it is very quiet from a far place.</p>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/3/35/Rejuvenatetherotten.png"/>
      <p>REJUVENATE THE ROTTEN</p>
      <p>1x1x1x1 stabs themselves with their swords and pulls them out, resurrecting any players that they killed in the form of rotten zombies that serve them.

Summoned zombies wander aimlessly upon spawning and target players that are within a 30 stud distance from them. They lose focus on their target if the distance between them & the target exceeds a distance of 50 studs. Summoned zombies have 5 health and deal 14 damage on contact.

Although the zombies are loyal to 1x1x1x1, 1x1x1x1 can kill them to gain Speed I for 10s. This ability starts off with 0 charges and a charge is given on kill, to a maximum of 1 charge.

Undocumented: Zombies have green auras that are revealed only to 1x1x1x1 while they are alive.</p>
